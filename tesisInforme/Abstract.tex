\chapter*{Abstract}
In this work, an automated system was developed for the calibration of ultrasonic wind measurement instruments using the wind tunnel of the National Meteorological Service. The system includes a datalogger developed with the EDU-CIAA board, responsible for acquiring wind data from the sensors, as well as for communication and control of the wind tunnel motor, replacing the manual measurement system. Additionally, a web application was developed using the Django framework and a WebSocket server with Django Channels to configure the datalogger, load relevant information about the sensors and the wind tunnel, present real-time measurements, and process the data using a comparison model to calculate the uncertainty and correction of the measurements. All the information is stored in a structured database. This work will enable the laboratory of the National Meteorological Service to achieve the capability to calibrate wind sensors, thereby meeting the demand of the network of automatic stations and the anemometer systems installed in the country.
