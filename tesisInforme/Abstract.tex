\chapter*{Abstract}
In this work, an automated system for the calibration of ultrasonic wind measurement instruments was developed, utilizing the wind tunnel of the National Meteorological Service. The system includes a datalogger developed with the EDU-CIAA board, responsible for acquiring wind data from the sensors, as well as for communication and control of the tunnel motor through a closed-loop PID controller, replacing the manual measurement system. Additionally, a web application was implemented using the Django framework and a WebSocket server with Django Channels to configure the datalogger, load relevant information about the sensors and the wind tunnel, present real-time measurements, and process the data using a comparative model to calculate the uncertainty and correction of the measurements. All the collected information is stored in a structured database, allowing efficient and organized access to the data. This development will enable the laboratory of the National Meteorological Service to calibrate wind sensors, thus meeting the demand of the network of automatic stations and the anemometer systems installed in the country.
