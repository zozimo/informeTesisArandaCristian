\chapter*{Abstract}
This work developed an automated system for calibrating ultrasonic wind measurement instruments using the wind tunnel of the National Meteorological Service. The system includes a datalogger developed with the EDU-CIAA board, responsible for acquiring wind data from the sensors, as well as for communication and control of the tunnel motor with a closed-loop PID controller, replacing the manual measurement system. Additionally, a web application was developed using the Django framework and a WebSocket server with Django Channels to configure the datalogger, load relevant information about the sensors and the wind tunnel, display real-time measurements, and process the data using a comparative model to calculate uncertainty and measurement corrections. All information is stored in a structured manner in a database. This work will enable the laboratory of the National Meteorological Service to achieve the capability to calibrate wind sensors, thus meeting the demand of the network of automatic stations and anemometer systems installed across the country.
